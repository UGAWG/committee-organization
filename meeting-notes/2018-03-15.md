# Participants:
 - Mike Park
 - Joshua Krakos
 - Dan Ibanez
 - Christos Tsolakis
 - Nikos Chrisochoides

# Agenda
- Journal paper, INRIA planning seperate Wolf paper, adaptive results in UGAWG and Wolf papers
- OM6 err est paper to journal
- Park todo: clean up results repo (LFS grids, re-write history, invalidate working copies)
  - make the repo the most useful for least amount of work

# Next Paper
- two draft papers
  - parallel execution
    - execution time (relative or absolute)
    - omega_h is consistent, metric conformity statistics for other codes
    - tau bench equivalent (run open source code on your machine)
    - everyone run on same architecture, compiler, mpi, ...
    - Park todo, add authors: Chrisochoides, Park, Barral, Ibanez, Tsolakis, Loseille, Michal
    - Submit to MVCE with Wymann
  - verification of Lp Metric and/or complete cycle
    - Mike put reference formulation in refine
    - have Hessian recovery L2-projection, add k-exact?
    - simple is best for verification
    - need curvature constraint only for initial grids?
    - need to limit change from current mesh?
    - export intermediate pieces for examination (Hessian, gradation control, ...)
    - how to compare two Hessians, two metrics (distance between)
    - Park todo, add authors: Park, Krakos, Loseille, Alauzet, Galbraith, Barral
    - Submit to MVCE with Wymann
  - Balan, Park, Anderson SciTech paper
  - Michal World Congress Computational Mechanics Talk
- lead author volunteer and where (IMR, SIAM, AIAA, TM)
- OM6 trailing edge had lowest shape measure (Dan considering a metric that accounts for geometry, sharp features)
- connection between histograms, measures, and solver performance
- examine difference in Hemisphere Cylinder viscous drag for Lp adapt and fixed-grid refinement
- low mean ratio often near the wall, study spatial distributional; where are these problems?
- SciTech 2018 deadlines (to estimate SciTech 2019 deadlines)
  - Abstract Submission Opens: 26 March 2018 
  - NASA/Boeing reviews: 11 May 2018 approx (about 5 pages)
  - Abstract Submission Closes: 11 June 2018, 2000 hrs Eastern Time Zone, USA
  - Author Notification: 31 August 2018
  - NASA/Boeing reviews: 05 November 2018
  - Manuscript Deadline: 04 December 2018, 2000 hrs Eastern Time Zone, USA

# Next meeting 14:00 UTC 19-April-2018 (via Boeing webex) 
- Every third Thursday going forward
- Park on vacation
