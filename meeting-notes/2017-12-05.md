 - Joshua Krakos
 - Todd
 - adrein
 - Nico Barral
 - Dmitry Kamenetskiy
 - Nick Wyman

# Discussion
- review talk
- review paper (ran FUN3D+refine further, refined wall distance discussion)
- wall distance
- decompose and verify Lp (and output)
- clean up repo (LFS grids, re-write history, invalidate working copies)
- make the repo the most useful for least amount of work
- github group landing page
- EGADS Lite byte stream in meshb
- EGADS Beta (source)


Refine
gradin cells, vol averge to nodes (twice)
Hessian cross derivatives average
Scaling / gradation (10 passes)
limiting to old grid happens after interp, so turns off later in process

INRIA
L2-projection (least squares similar results, needs detailed analysis)
first derivaties computed twice
Hessian cross derivatives average
Lp scaling
gradation
no limit on old grid

GGNS
(k-exact, second order ball) Least squares (firtst and second derivaties at once)
limiting in the cell centered
hessian at cell, based on node solution
metric computed cell based (some limits to old mesh)
interpolated to the nodes
gradation/ spactail avg. limiting at the nodes


# Discussion items from last meeting
- Josh uploaded new solb files for EPIC conformity
- Nico is looking into Pragmatic results for 100K HC
- Mike is continuing to plot results
- Dmitry showed much better LP results than Mike
- Mike will plot first cell height to understand differences in yplus
- Nick showed difference in FUN3D with different outer grid construction (unstructured v. voxel)
- Computing drag on metric conformity cases of interest
- Loic, Christos, and Nikos joined email list

# Action items for next meeting:
next steps:
mike put reference formulation in refine (befoe scitech) (solb)
update INRIA results in paper/talk

# Next Paper
- Lead author, where (IMR, SIAM, AIAA, TM)
- parallel exectution 
- OM6 trailing edge (metric that accounts for geomtery, sharp features)
- connection between histograms. measures and solvers
- differnce in visc drag for Lp/ fixed HC
- poor quality on the wall (spatial dist) where are these problems


# Next meeting 15:00 UTC 18-January-2017 (via Boeing webex)
- 10:00 EST
