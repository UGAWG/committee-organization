# Participants:
 - Mike Park
 - Dan Ibanez
 - Joshua Krakos
 - Todd Michal
 - Adrien Loseille
 - Nico Barral

# Agenda
- review talk
- review paper (ran FUN3D+refine further, refined wall distance discussion)
- decompose and verify Lp (and output)
- clean up repo (LFS grids, re-write history, invalidate working copies)
- make the repo the most useful for least amount of work
- github group landing page
- EGADS Lite byte stream keyword in meshb
- EGADS Beta (source)
- Loic, Christos, and Nikos joined email list
- Christos and Nikos used analytic metric case (plan to add metric interpolation)

# Action items for next meeting:
- update INRIA results in paper/talk
- Mike put reference formulation in refine
  - ideally before SciTech so Mike and Adrien can test and discuss
  - go -mach.solb to -metric.solb
  - L2-projection and k-exact

# Next Paper
- Lead author volunteer and where (IMR, SIAM, AIAA, TM)
- parallel execution 
- OM6 trailing edge had lowest shape measure (Dan considering a metric that accounts for geometry, sharp features)
- connection between histograms, measures, and solver performance
- Examine difference in Hemisphere Cylinder viscous drag for Lp adapt and fixed-grid refinement
- Low mean ratio often near the wall, study spatial distributional; where are these problems?

# FUN3D Lp metric
- L2-projection applied twice: gradient computed in tet, volume average of tet gradient to nodes
- Hessian cross derivatives averaged
- local Lp scaling
- global complexity scaling and gradation control (10 passes)
- limiting metric distance from original grid implied metric: inside of refine after input metric interpolation (naturally turns off later in adaptation process)

# INRIA Lp metric
- L2-projection applied twice
- least squares shows similar results, but needs detailed analysis to confirm
- Hessian cross derivatives averaged
- Gradation control
- no limit on metric distance to original grid implied metric

# GGNS Lp metric
- k-exact, second order ball, least-squares (first and second derivatives simultaneously) for cells based on nodal data
- limiting metric distance from original grid implied metric while cell centered
hessian at cell, based on node solution
- metric computed cell based
- metric averaged to the nodes
- gradation control limiting at the nodes

# Next meeting 15:00 UTC 18-January-2017 (via Boeing webex)
