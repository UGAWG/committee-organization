# AVIATION 2019 Abstract
 - "Geometry Modeling and Adaptive Grid Mechanics for Unstructured Grids" Park, Kleb, Jones, Loseille, Krakos, Michal, Dannenhoffer, Hamies
 - "Adjoint-based Anisotropic Mesh Adaptation for a Stabilized Finite Element Flow Solver" Balan, Park, Anderson

# Book on current state of parallel generation and adaptation
- Nikos is organizing
- Publisher go ahead, number of chapter commitments
- queeries continue at SciTech
- 15-20 page per chapter, August 2019 draft 
  - Boeing interested
  - Park: refine algorithm

# Discussion
- Intial grid generation for adaptation
  - curvature-based surface adapt before volume generation can imporve efficencey
  - isotropic initial voulume, then curvature adaptation of surface+volume
  - curvature can also coarsen for efficencey
  - some geometry topology modification can help
    - split large faces
    - split wrap-around faces
    - redo construction steps to eliminate very small (unitended) features
  - surface adapt can be a preview of problems diagnotics
- refine+MOESS gave poor results in SciTEch paper
  - Grid sizes produced by MOESS metric different between meshers
  - check the compexity to grid size ratio for test metrics
  - sinatan3 MOESS worst (multiscale seems ok)
- Todd, Christos, Mike, and Adrien? at SciTech
