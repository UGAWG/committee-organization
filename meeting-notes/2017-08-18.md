participants:
 - Mike Park
 - Todd Michal
 - Joshua Krakos
 - Nico Barral

progress:
- Mike updated EGADS/refine and EPIC initial grids to
  - 3D Hemisphere Cylinder (new hsc01 has repaired topo node index and UV parameters)
  - 3D ONERA M6 Wing
- Mike added 4th cycle (but hemisphere poles are tangled)
- CAD-Mesh association in .meshb
  - Edges
  - VerticesOnGeometricVertices
  - VerticesOnGeometricEdges (second real is zero)
  - VerticesOnGeometricTriangles (third real is zero)
- Mike is working with Pointwise to generate grids based on
- Mike is working to enable refine in MIT SANS solver to obtain MOESS metric
- John Dannenhoffer visited to test EGADS Lite (no OpenCASCADE dependency) with refine
- Dan looked at Hemisphere Cylinder hsc04 and found tangled surface triangles at polar singularities
- Boeing will setup webex for next meeting (if no issues for other people)
- Final IMR version submitted
- Mike create the IMR Talk (on overleaf)
  - Dan comments
    - slide 10: I would change "realize" to "satisfy"
    - I would include a slide or two listing all our codes with affiliations so people get a sense of whats been developed
  - plan to add little more results (one or two slides)
  - plan to add intro codes and participants (one slide)
  - rehearse at Langley late August
- Other participants did not see 3D Hemisphere Cylinder outflow boundary issue reported by GGNS
  - New (optional) grid available to close out cylinder before outflow boundary

action items for next meeting:
- Mike upload the 1st cycle of Hemisphere Cylinder mach and metric
- Mike still preforming cleanup before pushing to https://github.com/NASA/refine
- Todd investigate email horse as email list
- Everyone try .meshb, -mach.solb, and -metric.solb file formats
- Need to move to turbulent soon: 5-December-2017 due to AIAA, early November-2017 NASA/Boeing review
- Everyone with a CFD solver with provide Mach, Mach Hessian, and Metric in separate .solb files on initial grids
  - metric should include geometry limiting
  - take from first cycle and middle of convergence sequence
- Mike will contact authors (of other relevant published papers) to invite them to our group at IMR 2017

special session on Solver Technology for Turbulent Flows at AIAA SciTech-2018:
- Two cases with uniformly refined analytic grids and geometry
  - [3D Hemisphere Cylinder](https://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/hc3dnumericspart2_val.html)
  - [3D ONERA M6 Wing](https://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/onerawingnumerics_val.html)
- Expectation is DOF grid sizes in the 10s of millions; will explore thousands, millions, and 100s of millions
- Should use common solver/solution field to focus on adaptation 
- Examine different solvers/error estimation process separately
- keep solver, error estimation, metric formation, adaptation mechanics as orthogonal as possible
- Mike is planning FV and SFE with Mach hessian and Venditti error estimate
- MIT group may add DG and HDG with MOESS
- Frederic Alauzet wants to join the SciTech paper with Wolf
- provide INRIA .solb Mach scalar at nodes, request metric in INRIA .solb at notes
  - hessian recovery
  - gradation control
  - others aspects?
  - how to evaluate? metric conformity, visualize with ellipse, visualize with adapted mesh
- provide INRIA .solb metric, request new grid
  - use evaluation criteria from IMR paper

simpler test cases:
- Euler 3D Hemisphere Cylinder or 3D ONERA M6 Wing
- Laminar delta wing [AIAA](http://dx.doi.org/10.2514/6.2015-2292) [NASA](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20160006030)
- 3D flat plate
- any of the other [TMR](https://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/) verification cases
- 2D case extruded to unit span with symmetry planes (NACA 0012)
- Mike add 2D cases to solution-adapt-cases
  - first Solver Technology for Turbulent Flows session (NACA 0012 and flat plate)
  - see [TMR](https://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/) verification cases
  - Diamond airfoil from 2015 paper

Next meeting 14:00 UTC 15-September-2017 (via Boeing webex)
