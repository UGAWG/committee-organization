 - Mike Park
 - Todd Michal
 - Joshua Krakos
 - Nico Barral
 - Nick Wyman
 - Adrien Loseille
 - Dmitry Kamenetskiy

# Paper
- Three seperate integrated approaches or "silos"
  - GGNS+EPIC (Lp Mach, output)
  - FUN3D+refine (Lp Mach)
  - Wolf+Fefloa (Lp Mach)
- Discuss issues Lp slow to converge
- Iterating at fixed complexity helpful to reduce yplus
- Addition of boundary layers accelerate
- Output based out performs Lp
- Comparisons of metric conformity
  - 25K complxity (50K nodes)
  - 100K complexity (200K nodes)
- Compare cases with either outflow boundary

# Action items for next meeting:
- Mike post 4 grids
  - metric should include geometry limiting
  - 50K and 200K nodes
- Mike write! 5-December-2017 due to AIAA, early November-2017 NASA/Boeing review
- Adrien and Mike add their "silos"
- Mike reuse discription of Boeing method from DPW/High Lift papers
- Everyone try .meshb, -mach.solb, and -metric.solb file formats
- Mike will contact authors (of other relevant published papers) to invite them to our group at IMR 2017
- Mike contact Christian Jensen at IMR 2017

# Discussion
- support of AIAA TC or IMR available

# Moving to Turbulent
- OM6 and HC are benign enough that raw Lp metric may be suitable (but not optimal)
  - HC is smooth in tangential direction
  - OM6 is smooth in spanwise direction (2D like)
- Could replace y+<100 normal metric with exponential growth to converge faster (but would use tangent metric off surface)
- EPIC ignores metric when installing structured boundary layer
- Curvature constraints
  - EPIC uses 16-24 points per 360 degrees based on radius of curvature
  - refine uses 60 points per 360 degrees based on radius of curvature, but may try less
  - Feflo.a uses a different accounting system  

# Special session on Solver Technology for Turbulent Flows at AIAA SciTech-2018:
- Two cases with uniformly refined analytic grids and geometry
  - [3D Hemisphere Cylinder](https://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/hc3dnumericspart2_val.html)
  - [3D ONERA M6 Wing](https://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/onerawingnumerics_val.html)
- Expectation is DOF grid sizes in the 10s of millions; will explore thousands, millions, and 100s of millions
- Should use common solver/solution field to focus on adaptation 
- Examine different solvers/error estimation process separately
- keep solver, error estimation, metric formation, adaptation mechanics as orthogonal as possible
- Mike is planning FV and SFE with Mach hessian and Venditti error estimate
- MIT group may add DG and HDG with MOESS
- Frederic Alauzet wants to join the SciTech paper with Wolf
- provide INRIA .solb Mach scalar at nodes, request metric in INRIA .solb at notes
  - hessian recovery
  - gradation control
  - others aspects?
  - how to evaluate? metric conformity, visualize with ellipse, visualize with adapted mesh
- provide INRIA .solb metric, request new grid
  - use evaluation criteria from IMR paper

# Simpler test cases:
- Euler 3D Hemisphere Cylinder or 3D ONERA M6 Wing
- Laminar delta wing [AIAA](http://dx.doi.org/10.2514/6.2015-2292) [NASA](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20160006030)
- 3D flat plate
- any of the other [TMR](https://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/) verification cases
- 2D case extruded to unit span with symmetry planes (NACA 0012)
- Mike add 2D cases to solution-adapt-cases
  - first Solver Technology for Turbulent Flows session (NACA 0012 and flat plate)
  - see [TMR](https://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/) verification cases
  - Diamond airfoil from 2015 paper

# CAD-Mesh association in .meshb
- Edges
- VerticesOnGeometricVertices
- VerticesOnGeometricEdges (second real is zero)
- VerticesOnGeometricTriangles (third real is zero)

# Next meeting 19:00 UTC 19-October-2017 (via Boeing webex)
