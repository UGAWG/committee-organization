participants:
 - Mike Park
 - Todd Michal
 - Joshua Krakos
 - Nico Barral

progress:
- IMR paper accepted
- Mike added EGADS/refine and EPIC initial grids to
  - 3D Hemisphere Cylinder
  - 3D ONERA M6 Wing
- Dan setup [solution-adapt-results](https://github.com/UGAWG/solution-adapt-results) repo with LFS enabled
- refine is available via Apache 2.0 as a tar ball from Mike
  - Mike still preforming cleanup before pushing to https://github.com/NASA/refine
- Mike is working with Pointwise to generate grids based on
  - RBF interpolated isotropic spacing
  - RBF interpolated anisotropic metric (log-Euclidean)
  - 3D ONERA M6 Wing test case
- Mike is working to enable refine in MIT SANS solver to obtain MOESS metric

action items for next meeting:
- Boeing will setup webex for next meeting
- Final IMR version due 08-August-2017
  - Nico reformat histogram figures to make more legible
  - Dan respond to minor review items
- Mike create the IMR Talk (on overleaf) 
- Josh will create new initial grids based on IGES
- Mike will communicate issues with 3D Hemisphere Cylinder outflow boundary reported by GGNS
  - Work is underway to close out cylinder before outflow boundary
- Everyone with a CFD solver with provide Mach, Mach Hessian, and Metric in separate .solb files on initial grids
  - metric should include geometry limiting
  - talk from middle of convergence sequence
- Topic Mike forgot to raise for next month: standardizing CAD-Mesh association 
- Mike will also add 2D cases to solution-adapt-cases
  - first Solver Technology for Turbulent Flows session (NACA 0012 and flat plate)
  - see [TMR](https://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/) verification cases
  - Diamond airfoil from 2015 paper
- Mike will contact authors (of other relevant published papers) to invite them to our group

special session on Solver Technology for Turbulent Flows at AIAA SciTech-2018:
- Two cases with uniformly refined analytic grids and geometry
  - [3D Hemisphere Cylinder](https://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/hc3dnumericspart2_val.html)
  - [3D ONERA M6 Wing](https://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/onerawingnumerics_val.html)
- Expectation is DOF grid sizes in the 10s of millions; will explore thousands, millions, and 100s of millions
- Should use common solver/solution field to focus on adaptation 
- Examine different solvers/error estimation process separately
- keep solver, error estimation, metric formation, adaptation mechanics as orthogonal as possible
- Mike is planning FV and SFE with Mach hessian and Venditti error estimate
- MIT group may add DG and HDG with MOESS
- Frederic Alauzet wants to join the SciTech paper with Wolf
- provide INRIA .solb Mach scalar at nodes, request metric in INRIA .solb at notes
  - hessian recovery
  - gradation control
  - others aspects?
  - how to evaluate? metric conformity, visualize with ellipse, visualize with adapted mesh
- provide INRIA .solb metric, request new grid
  - use evaluation criteria from IMR paper

simpler test cases:
- Euler 3D Hemisphere Cylinder or 3D ONERA M6 Wing
- Laminar delta wing [AIAA](http://dx.doi.org/10.2514/6.2015-2292) [NASA](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20160006030)
- 3D flat plate
- any of the other [TMR](https://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/) verification cases
- 2D case extruded to unit span with symmetry planes (NACA 0012)

Next meeting 14:00 UTC 18-August-2017 (via Boeing webex)
