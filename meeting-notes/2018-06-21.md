# Participants:
 - Mike Park
 - Joshua Krakos
 - Dan Ibanez
 - Christos Tsolakis
 - Nikos Chrisochoides

# Agenda
- Journal paper, INRIA planning seperate Wolf paper, adaptive results in UGAWG and Wolf papers
- OM6 err est paper to journal
- Park todo: clean up results repo (LFS grids, re-write history, invalidate working copies)
  - make the repo the most useful for least amount of work
- two draft papers submitted to MVCE with Wymann
  - parallel execution
  - error estimation verification
- Michal World Congress Computational Mechanics Talk

# Parallel SciTech 2019 Paper
- Two test cases will be used: 
  - The first one  will be a unit cube with the quarter cylinder the analytic metric described at [CITE Marcum Frederic paper]
  - The other will be determined later, suggestions are welcome for the next meeting. Maybe something from the NASA common research set ?
- For the cube case we will use three subcases each  with a goal of generating different number of elements. 1 million, 100 million 1 Billion
- Each participating software may run on any kind of hardware with as many cores as needed.
- Add specs of the machine : core frequency, amount (and speed) of RAM, number of cores, etc.
- In the results include tets/sec or vertices/sec as a measure of performance
- include performance of sequential code i.e., single core. 

# Parallel SciTech 2019 Paper
 - Focus on OM6 TMR Case 2308: Minf=0.84, Rec_root=14.6 x 106, AoA=3.06 deg, Tinf=540 R.
 - Include analytic scalar field?
 - Mike, Aravind, Kyle
   - FUN3D-FV and FUN3D-SFE with  refine multiscale metric + refine grid mechanics
   - refine multiscale metric:
     - compare k-exact and L2-projection Hessian reconstruction,
     - show impact of gradation control
 - Todd, Josh, and Dmitry
   - GGNS+EPIC with the refine multiscale metric and Boeing multiscale metric
   - GGNS+refine with the refine multiscale metric and Boeing multiscale metric
 - Adrien and Frederic
   - Wolf+Feflo.a with the refine multiscale metric and INRIA multiscale metric
   - Wolf+refine with the refine multiscale metric and INRIA multiscale metric
 - Hugh and Marshall
   - SANS+MOESS with refine and EPIC
   - SANS+refine multiscale metric with refine and EPIC
 - Nicolas
   - Does your group have a compressible flow solver?
     If not, we could also include an analytic function like
     Adrien's AIAA-2007-4186 paper.

# Discussion
- k-exact nodal Hessian reconstruction produces better
  results than L2-Projection for multiscale metric
- disabling gradation (or making very large, 10) produces better
  results for multiscale metric
