# Next Next paper ideas (or topics for graduate students)
- linear mesh behavior for curved geometry
- multiscale (Hessian) radial gradient becomes tangential 2nd derivative
- does MOESS L2-norm or RANS show the same level of tangential refinement
- P1 vs. P2 (does high order capture the solution curvature)
- transform curved domain to Cartesian
- transform to cylindrical coordinates?
- scaling of shocks vs. boundary layer?
  - adaptation to Spalding law-of-wall and shock model (tanh?)
- metric gradation? impact on accuracy, solver convergence?
