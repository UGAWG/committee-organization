# Parallel SciTech 2019 Paper
- In NASA and Boeing reviews
- Migrated to ODU GitHub (external access? Mike+Christos will be pathfinder)
- Two test cases will be used: 
  - The first one  will be a unit cube with polar-2 from previous UGAWG paper
  - The second is the delta-wing for metric
- submit the results at https://github.com/UGAWG/parallel-adapt-results.git
