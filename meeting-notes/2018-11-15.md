# Parallel SciTech 2019 Paper
- In NASA and Boeing reviews
- Migrated to ODU GitHub (external access? Mike+Christos will be pathfinder)
- Two test cases will be used: 
  - The first one  will be a unit cube with polar-2 from previous UGAWG paper
  - The second is the delta-wing for metric
- submit the results at https://github.com/UGAWG/parallel-adapt-results.git

# Error Estimation SciTech 2019 Paper
 - In NASA and Boeing reviews
 - Marshall analytic scalar field
 - Laminar Delta Wing for FV+DG (no grid curving)
 - OM6 TMR Case 2308: Minf=0.84, Rec_root=14.6 x 106, AoA=3.06 deg, Tinf=540 R.
 - rehearse talk in December

# AVIATION 2019 Abstract
 - "Geometry Modeling and Adaptive Grid Mechanics for Unstructured Grids" Park, Kleb, Jones, Loseille, Krakos, Michal, Dannenhoffer, Hamies
 - "Adjoint-based Anisotropic Mesh Adaptation for a Stabilized Finite Element Flow Solver" Balan, Park, Anderson
 - "Sketch-to-Solution: An Exploration of Viscous CFD with Automatic Grids" Kleb, Park, Wood, Bibb, Thompson, Gomez
 - "Hybrid RANS/LES Simulation of Vortex Breakdown Over a Delta Wing" Zhou, Diskin, Pardue, Chernikov, Tsolakis, Drakopoulos, Chrisochoides

# Book on current state of parallel generation and adaptation
- Nikos is organizing
- Publisher go ahead, number of chapter commitments
- queeries continue at SciTech
- 15-20 page per chapter, August 2019 draft 
  - Boeing interested
  - Park: refine algorithm

# Discussion
- Intial grid generation for adaptation
  - curvature-based surface adapt before volume generation can imporve efficencey
  - isotropic initial voulume, then curvature adaptation of surface+volume
  - curvature can also coarsen for efficencey
  - some geometry topology modification can help
    - split large faces
    - split wrap-around faces
    - redo construction steps to eliminate very small (unitended) features
  - surface adapt can be a preview of problems diagnotics
- refine+MOESS gave poor results in SciTEch paper
  - Grid sizes produced by MOESS metric different between meshers
  - check the compexity to grid size ratio for test metrics
  - sinatan3 MOESS worst (multiscale seems ok)
- Todd, Christos, Mike, and Adrien? at SciTech
