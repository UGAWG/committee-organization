# Participants:
 - Mike Park
 - Todd Michal
 - Joshua Krakos
 - Nico Barral
 - Nick Wyman
 - Adrien Loseille

# Progress:
- Adrien provided an adapted grid and metric pair for Euler hemisphere-cylinder
- Mike updated EGADS/refine and EPIC initial grids with CAD association
- Mike is working with Pointwise to generate grids based on interpolated metric
- Mike is working to enable refine (also Feflo.a and EPIC)
  in MIT SANS solver to obtain MOESS metric
- New (optional) grid and geometry available to close out cylinder before outflow boundary
- Mike uploaded the 1st cycle of Hemisphere Cylinder and ONERA M6 mach and metric
- Mike pushed https://github.com/NASA/refine

# Action items for next meeting:
- Todd investigate email horse as email list
- Everyone try .meshb, -mach.solb, and -metric.solb file formats
- Need to move to turbulent soon: 5-December-2017 due to AIAA, early November-2017 NASA/Boeing review
- Everyone with a CFD solver with provide Mach, Mach Hessian, and Metric in separate .solb files on initial grids
  - metric should include geometry limiting
  - take from first cycle and middle of convergence sequence
- Mike will contact authors (of other relevant published papers) to invite them to our group at IMR 2017

# Special session on Solver Technology for Turbulent Flows at AIAA SciTech-2018:
- Two cases with uniformly refined analytic grids and geometry
  - [3D Hemisphere Cylinder](https://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/hc3dnumericspart2_val.html)
  - [3D ONERA M6 Wing](https://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/onerawingnumerics_val.html)
- Expectation is DOF grid sizes in the 10s of millions; will explore thousands, millions, and 100s of millions
- Should use common solver/solution field to focus on adaptation 
- Examine different solvers/error estimation process separately
- keep solver, error estimation, metric formation, adaptation mechanics as orthogonal as possible
- Mike is planning FV and SFE with Mach hessian and Venditti error estimate
- MIT group may add DG and HDG with MOESS
- Frederic Alauzet wants to join the SciTech paper with Wolf
- provide INRIA .solb Mach scalar at nodes, request metric in INRIA .solb at notes
  - hessian recovery
  - gradation control
  - others aspects?
  - how to evaluate? metric conformity, visualize with ellipse, visualize with adapted mesh
- provide INRIA .solb metric, request new grid
  - use evaluation criteria from IMR paper

# Simpler test cases:
- Euler 3D Hemisphere Cylinder or 3D ONERA M6 Wing
- Laminar delta wing [AIAA](http://dx.doi.org/10.2514/6.2015-2292) [NASA](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20160006030)
- 3D flat plate
- any of the other [TMR](https://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/) verification cases
- 2D case extruded to unit span with symmetry planes (NACA 0012)
- Mike add 2D cases to solution-adapt-cases
  - first Solver Technology for Turbulent Flows session (NACA 0012 and flat plate)
  - see [TMR](https://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/) verification cases
  - Diamond airfoil from 2015 paper

# CAD-Mesh association in .meshb
- Edges
- VerticesOnGeometricVertices
- VerticesOnGeometricEdges (second real is zero)
- VerticesOnGeometricTriangles (third real is zero)

# Next meetings 19:00 UTC 5-October-2017 and 19-October-2017 (via Boeing webex)
