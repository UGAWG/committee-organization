# Agenda
- scitech, turb solver special session, and paper debrief 
  - boris section paper
  - boeing adaptation GMGW and HighLift (max lift prediction)
  - boeing+inria OM6 error estimation, identify issues
    - exchange grids with same results
    - error est may not be tied to discretization
    - wolf (FV) able to run to the wall
- issues that remain from scitech papers
  - verfication process and components
- geometry access with pointwise kernel - Nick 15 min future meeting
  - trade cases / work on geometry with differnt kernels
  - geom assoication
  - tolerarncing, gaps, geom issues
- decompose and verify Lp (and output)
  - Mike put reference formulation in refine
  - Have hessisn recovery L2-projection, add k-exact?
  - simple is best
  - curvature for inital grids?
  - change from current mesh?
  - export intermediate pieces (hessian, ...)
  - how to compare two hessians, two metrics (distance between)
- clean up repo (LFS grids, re-write history, invalidate working copies)
- make the repo the most useful for least amount of work
- github group landing page ugawg.github.io
- plan next paper
- space time geometry definiation
- metric representaion and interpolation
  - pertibation from current mesh (implied metric)
  - shape measures are also considered
  - mesh equivlice
- mesh curving
- err est P>1

# Next Paper
- topics
  - parallel execution
    - exectuion time (relative or absolute)
    - metric conformity 
    - omega_h is consitant
    - tau bench equlivent
    - same arch, compiler, mpi, ...
  - verification of Lp Metric and/or complete cycle
  - Aravind, Park, Anderson SciTech
  - Todd World Congress Computational Mechanics
- Lead author volunteer and where (IMR, SIAM, AIAA, TM)
- OM6 trailing edge had lowest shape measure (Dan considering a metric that accounts for geometry, sharp features)
- connection between histograms, measures, and solver performance
- Examine difference in Hemisphere Cylinder viscous drag for Lp adapt and fixed-grid refinement
- Low mean ratio often near the wall, study spatial distributional; where are these problems?

# Next meeting 15:00 UTC 8-February-2017 or 22-February-2017 (via Boeing webex)
