# Agenda
- SciTech, turbulence solver special session, and paper debrief 
  - Turbulence solver special session great verification exercise
  - Boeing adaptation papers for GMGW and HighLift-3 (max lift prediction)
  - Boeing+INRIA OM6 error estimation, identify issues
    - found implementation differences
    - exchange grids with same results
    - error estimation may not be tied to discretization
    - Wolf (FV) able to run with grids adapted to the wall by GGNS (SUPG)
- issues that remain from SciTech papers
  - verification of complete adaptation process and components
- geometry access with PointWise kernel - Nick 15 min talk next meeting
  - ability to exchange cases and work on geometry with different kernels
  - geometry association
  - tolerance, gaps, small faces, small edges, etc.
- decompose and verify Lp (and output)
  - Mike put reference formulation in refine
  - have Hessian recovery L2-projection, add k-exact?
  - simple is best for verification
  - need curvature constraint only for initial grids?
  - need to limit change from current mesh?
  - export intermediate pieces for examination (Hessian, gradation control, ...)
  - how to compare two Hessians, two metrics (distance between)
- clean up results repo (LFS grids, re-write history, invalidate working copies)
  - make the repo the most useful for least amount of work
- GitHub group landing page https://ugawg.github.io added
- explore space time geometry definition
- metric representation and interpretation
  - perturbation from current mesh (implied metric)
  - shape measures are also considered
  - what is mesh equivalence
  - is there are better criteria then metric conformity
- also consider mesh curving
- also consider error estimation and metric formation for p>1 solutions

# Next Paper
- topics
  - parallel execution
    - execution time (relative or absolute)
    - omega_h is consistent, metric conformity statistics for other codes
    - tau bench equivalent (run open source code on your machine)
    - everyone run on same architecture, compiler, mpi, ...
  - verification of Lp Metric and/or complete cycle
  - Balan, Park, Anderson SciTech paper
  - Michal World Congress Computational Mechanics Talk
- lead author volunteer and where (IMR, SIAM, AIAA, TM)
- OM6 trailing edge had lowest shape measure (Dan considering a metric that accounts for geometry, sharp features)
- connection between histograms, measures, and solver performance
- examine difference in Hemisphere Cylinder viscous drag for Lp adapt and fixed-grid refinement
- low mean ratio often near the wall, study spatial distributional; where are these problems?

# Next meeting 15:00 UTC 22-February-2017 (via Boeing webex)
