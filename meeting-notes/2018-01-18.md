# Participants:
 - Mike Park
 - Dan Ibanez
 - Joshua Krakos
 - Todd Michal
 - Adrien Loseille
 - Nico Barral

# Agenda
- scitech, turb solver special session, and paper debrief 
- issues that remain from scitech papers
- decompose and verify Lp (and output)
  - Mike put reference formulation in refine
  - Have L2-projection, add k-exact?
- clean up repo (LFS grids, re-write history, invalidate working copies)
- make the repo the most useful for least amount of work
- github group landing page
- plan next paper

# Next Paper
- topics
  - parallel execution
  - verification of Lp Metric
- Lead author volunteer and where (IMR, SIAM, AIAA, TM)
- OM6 trailing edge had lowest shape measure (Dan considering a metric that accounts for geometry, sharp features)
- connection between histograms, measures, and solver performance
- Examine difference in Hemisphere Cylinder viscous drag for Lp adapt and fixed-grid refinement
- Low mean ratio often near the wall, study spatial distributional; where are these problems?


# Next meeting 15:00 UTC 8-February-2017 or 22-February-2017 (via Boeing webex)
