# AVIATION 2021 intro paper on boundary representation tolerence background
- NASA/Boeing review deadlines: 01 Apr 2021
- Manuscript Deadline: 04 May 2021
- problems, examples, implications, and strategies
- tolerance, gaps, etc. vs. meshing requirements (surface, y+)
- example solutions provided, follow on paper targeted for Scitech 2022 (or IMR)
- Exampels and fixes for HLPW4 HL-CRM
  - Boeing found gap after 250M, undersized surface (compared to trim curves)
  - windshield curvature
  - geometry 1 had a circle tangent issue, resolved with 1a
  - curving FG using juncture flow model (simplified was missing faces)
- multiscale adaptation to Spalding law-of-wall

# GMGW-2.5 Mesh Effects
   - AIAA journal submission: Boeing, NASA, INRIA, MIT
   - Todd resubmit and share for NASA review
   - MIT paper submitted

# SciTech 2021
- NASA/Boeing review deadlines: 01 Nov 2020
- Manuscript Deadline: 01 Dec 2020
- Verification of output metric in AIAA-2019-3947
  - analytic field with entropy adjoint
    - BCFD analytic solution
    - share adapt meshes for plotting
    - viscous differences between INRIA and NASA+Boeing
    - Marshall created MMS and modified field
  - Ringleb moved to appendix (analytic emtropy exactly zero)
  - laminar delta wing
  - laminar OM6
- Next paper
  - eval: draw ellipses, difference in metric fields (delta), metric conformity
  - understand scaling

# Proposed journal article on hold
- Fixed Grid verification extracted from adaptation for Hybrid RANS-LES
  - Beckett, NASA
  - SU2: SA-DDES, SA-DDES-SLA; FUN3D-FV: SA-DDES, SA-DDES-SLA, FUN3D-SFE SA-DDES
- SU2+FUN verification on hold due to solver difficulty

# Discussion
- Surrogate that stores displacements (in t/uv) to make CAD watertight/design?
  - ONERA M6 with refine
- EGADS exploring effective (virtual) topology
- MeshLink support released by Pointwise, initial use in refine (restart)
- testing FUN3D-FV-HANIM, FUN3D-SFE, USM3D-HANIM
  - 2D and 3D benchmark cases with focus on convergence
  - subsonic in good shape, moving to transonic and supersonic (seeing progress)
  - isolated subset of FUN3D-FV issues to the Cb2 term in the SA
- Multiscale slow on small features (nozzle) in large domains
  - Papers from the VULCAN group on hypersonic benchmarks
  - multiscale adaptation to Spalding law-of-wall
  - involve gradation, weaken gradation in practice, solver convergence? 
  - FV vs. FE 
  - not needed for supersonic is FV, not used with (S)FE  
- refine+MOESS results in SciTech 2021 paper equivalent to EPIC
  - complexity interpretation

# Next full group meeting 10:00AM Eastern US 17-DEC-2020 (via Boeing webex)
- Every third Thursday going forward (via Boeing webex)
- JAN meeting second week of SciTech
