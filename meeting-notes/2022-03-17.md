    Todd, Mike
    - test cases defined, released
    - case 1: verification (2D HL-CRM airfoil) (11 teams)
    - case 2: steady RANS in linear range (11 teams)
    - case 3: steady RANS in across polar (6 teams)
    - case 4: flap increment study (2 teams)
    - May include comparison to fixed meshes
    - joint presentation at workshop
    - participant list published
    - Geometry (2v) https://hiliftpw.larc.nasa.gov/Workshop4/geometries.html
  - Great group effort! lowest variation of TFG
  - Some multiple solutions resolved with mesh refinement and more particapnts
  - Eddy-resolving seem as cure for multiple solutions
  - Turbulence models other than SA, not explored

# Next paper (Dmitry SciTech 2022 abstract)
Paper in Co-author/NASA/Boeing review.
Need to submit talk to NASA review static pdf/ppt (in-person).
Paper and Talk due 02 December 2020 to AIAA.
- future work for SciTech 2021 paper
- understand scaling of NASA/BOEING and INRIA
- alternative presentation of AIAA-2019-3947 metric
- implementation recipe available
- verification cases
  - Laminar delta
  - hemisphere cylinder
  - CRM-HL

# Next Next paper ideas (or topics for graduate students)
- linear mesh behavior for curved geometry
- multiscale (Hessian) radial gradient becomes tangential 2nd derivative
- does MOESS L2-norm or RANS show the same level of tangential refinement
- P1 vs. P2 (does high order capture the solution curvature)
- transform curved domain to Cartesian
- transform to cylindrical coordinates?
- scaling of shocks vs. boundary layer?
  - adaptation to Spalding law-of-wall and shock model (tanh?)
- metric gradation? impact on accuracy, solver convergence? 

# Parallel journal article
- Volume 59, Number 11, November 2021

# Eddy Resolving Meshing
- topic for future "exploration" paper
- create unit problems for eddy-resolving adaptation, wall models, anisotropy
- time vary analytic function to verify Barral metric
- segregate multiscale interpolation control from wall models
- infer yplus for instantaneous snapshots (yplus is RANS concept)
- consistency with wall model (meshing to a yplus expectation of wall model)
- HRLES blending function to control aspect ratio to compress "gray-area"
- HRLES aspect ratio controlled by DDES blending
- mesh based filter width or physics based filter width for LES
- should tetrahedra be used at wall? mixed elements at wall or interior? solver preference
- reached out to Johan Larsson to discuss anisotropy and wall model needs
- Marshall + student join disussion: WMLES mesh adapt in SANS, Statistical errors
- WMLES resolving transition, laminar separation, etc and interactions with wall models

# Discussion
- Dissipation in the FV solver has huge impact on results and solver (Joukowsky airfoil)
- Tangential wiggles in shocks FV (and their wake) is resolved: limiters, flux function dissipation, etc.
- Gabe Nastac - SciTech paper on flux functions, mixed-element adapt
- Starting quad insertion in 2D with refine
- continuous err est trace(M^(-1/2)|H|M^(-1/2)) Mopt = det(|H|)^(-1/(2p+d))|H|
- discrete err est integral(|Q2-Q1|)
- is multiscale equidistributing error? tried to extend to multiple sensors
- multiscale slow on small features (nozzle) in large domains
- multiscale slow to discover/resolve nonlinear (transported) features
- shocks overresolved (unless artificial dissipation limits hessian)?
- cases with poor edge curves
- pcurve t optimization to match edge t location (slip gap)
- Discrete surrogate with equivalent edge and pcurve parameterization P1,P2,P3
  - discontinuous slope artifacts at coarse resolution 
- EGADS effective (virtual) topology
  - evaluates underlying geometry derivatives, finite-difference blend region
  - alpha testing underway

# Next full group meeting 10:00AM Eastern US 14-APR-2022
- April meeting one week early
- Every third Thursday going forward (via Boeing webex, Josh manage series)
