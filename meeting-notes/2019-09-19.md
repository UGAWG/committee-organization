# 3rd AIAA Geometry and Mesh Generation and 4th High Lift Prediction Workshops
  - special session invited paper (AVIATION 2020?)  
     - provide adapted grids at same vertex count to participants
     - encourage sharing grids between solvers (e.g., FE, FV, NC, CC, commercial)
  - Workshop AVIATION 2021? 
     - include adaptation component
     - involve UGAWG
  - AIAA MV-TC discussion group
     - make plan of attack for AIAA MV-TC (and maybe IMR) integration by AVIATION conference

# Third Sonic Boom Prediction Workshop
- biconvex 9x7 wind tunnel shock-plume test
   - includes 3 fixed HeldenMesh and 5 refine+FUN3D-FV+MachMultiscale meshes 
   - Problems converging adpated grids reported
- C608 model
   - includes 5 fixed HeldenMesh with collar grids
   - engine BCs sorted

# AVIATION 2020 (Oct/Nov)
 - submit abstract (GMGW)
   - sample cases (unit problems) we could propose?
   - committee define cases timeline?
     - cut thorough HL-CRM wing
     - double check with committee on availability
   - 14x22 geometry avail?
   - Todd lead

# SciTech 2020 Dates
- Author Notifications 30 August 2019
- NASA/Boeing review deadlines 1 November 2019
- Manuscript Deadline: 2 December 2019, 2000 hrs Eastern Time 

# SciTech 2020 Papers
- Output/goal/adjoint metrics for RANS (Balan, Park, Anderson)
- Grid adaptation for Hybrid RANS-LES
  - Build off of NIA/ODU AVIATION paper
  - fixed-point metric for time-accurate HRLES
    - unit problems delta wing, cylinder/ tandem cylinder, etc.
    - Run adapted grids with SU2 (w/ Zhou)
    - JSM WB primary with HL-CRM backup
  - Multiscale Mach RANS
    - JSM WB primary with HL-CRM backup through max-lift
    - WBNP? solvers?

# Book on current state of parallel generation and adaptation
- Nikos is organizing
- waiting on template from publisher
- publisher go ahead, number of chapter commitments
- queries continue at SciTech
- 15-20 page per chapter, August 2019 draft 
  - Boeing interested
  - Park: refine algorithm

# Discussion
- focus on refine metric conformity
  - continuous metric interpolation and plaint smoothing implemented in refine
  - cavity operators extended to for simultaneous surface and volume changes
  - cube-cylinder polar-2 seq and 4 cores
    - edge length [0.3-1.6] was [0.01-3.1]
    - mean ratio > 0.400 was > 0.008
    - 2.1 vertex/complexity was 2.22
- refine+MOESS gave poor results in SciTech paper
  - 2D results are equal to Avro and EPIC
  - Grid sizes produced by MOESS metric different between meshers
  - check the complexity to grid size ratio for test metrics
  - sinatan3 MOESS worst (multiscale seems ok)
  - use UGAWG cases to improve metric conformity
- EPIC+MOESS interaction
- reach out to members

# Next meeting 10:00AM Eastern US 17-Sep-2019 (via Boeing webex)
- Every third Thursday going forward
- Park on vacation, available the 24th
