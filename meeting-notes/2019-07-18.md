  - SFE adjoint development
  - implementing published error estimates and metric construction
    - INRIA optimal-goal metric with viscous fluxes (weak BCs?)
    - extruded diamond airfoil AIAA-2015-2292, lamiar NACA0012
    - laminar delta wing and RANS-SA OM6 over refinement of leading edge
- "Sketch-to-Solution: An Exploration of Viscous CFD with Automatic Grids" Kleb, Park, Wood, Bibb, Thompson, Gomez

  - SU2
  - 20M nodes, 100M cell typical: see DPW history, HL 300M median
  - fixed mesh: advancing layer and outer unstructured targeting larger grids
  - SA steady multiscale adaptive 10M, targeting larger grids
  - running steady adapted grids with HRLES, anisotropy damp eddies
  - construct metric from HRLES solution that is more isotropic
  - Mike Park not joining paper to extend deadline (helping eval grids)
    - SciTech abstract adding Mike and Qiqi Wang with adaption?

# Book on current state of parallel generation and adaptation
- Nikos is organizing
- waiting on template from publisher
- publisher go ahead, number of chapter commitments
- queries continue at SciTech
- 15-20 page per chapter, August 2019 draft 
  - Boeing interested
  - Park: refine algorithm

# Discussion
- refine+MOESS gave poor results in SciTech paper
  - Grid sizes produced by MOESS metric different between meshers
  - check the complexity to grid size ratio for test metrics
  - sinatan3 MOESS worst (multiscale seems ok)
  - implementing continuous metric interpolation in refine
- EPIC+MOESS interaction
- reach out to members

# 3rd AIAA Geometry and Mesh Generation and 4th High Lift Prediction Workshops
  - special session invited paper (AVIATION 2020?)  
     - provide adapted grids at same vertex count to participants
     - encourage sharing grids between solvers (e.g., FE, FV, NC, CC, commercial)
  - Workshop AVIATION 2021? 
     - include adaptation component
     - involve UGAWG
  - AIAA MV-TC discussion group
     - make plan of attack for AIAA MV-TC (and maybe IMR) integration by AVIATION conference

# Next meeting 10:00AM Eastern US 18-Jul-2019 (via Boeing webex)
- Skip next Month, Face-to-face to meeting at AVIATION? Lunch tue-thu?
- Every third Thursday going forward
