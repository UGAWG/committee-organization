# AVIATION 2021 intro paper on boundary representation tolerence background
- NASA/Boeing review deadlines: 01 Apr 2021
- Manuscript Deadline: 04 May 2021
- sent out outine and schedule
- problems, examples, implications, and strategies
  - include curved meshing for higher order
- tolerance, gaps, etc. vs. meshing requirements (surface, y+)
- example solutions provided, follow on paper targeted for Scitech 2022 (or IMR)
- Examples and fixes for HLPW4 HL-CRM
  - Boeing found gap after 250M, undersized surface (compared to trim curves)
  - windshield curvature
  - geometry 1 had a circle tangent issue, resolved with 1a
  - curving FG using juncture flow model (simplified was missing faces)
- multiscale adaptation to Spalding law-of-wall
  - analytic geometry (e.g, offset cylinder)

# SciTech 2021
- paper and talk submitted

# Next paper (Dmitry SciTech 2022 abstract)
- future work for SciTech 2021 paper
  - alternative presention of AIAA-2019-3947 metric
  - understand scaling
  - eval: draw ellipses, difference in metric fields (delta), metric conformity
- linear mesh behavor for curved geometry
- multiscale (Hessian) radial gradient becomes tangential 2nd derivative
- does MOESS L2-norm or RANS show the same level of tangential refinement
- P1 vs. P2 (does high order capture the solution curvature)
- transform curved domain to Cartesian
- transform to cylindrical coordinates?
- scaling of shocks vs. boundary layer?
  - adaptation to Spalding law-of-wall and shock model (tanh?)
- metric gradation? impact on accuracy, solver convergence? 

# GMGW-2.5 Mesh Effects
- AIAA journal submission: Boeing, NASA, INRIA, MIT
- Todd accept with minor revision
  - Help with review comments
- MIT paper completed peer review response

# Parallel journal article
- submitted, under peer review

# Proposed journal article on hold
- Fixed Grid verification extracted from adaptation for Hybrid RANS-LES
  - Beckett, NASA
  - SU2: SA-DDES, SA-DDES-SLA; FUN3D-FV: SA-DDES, SA-DDES-SLA, FUN3D-SFE SA-DDES

# SU2+FUN verification on hold due to solver difficulty
  - Juan Alonso high lift (intro with Christos) and HLPW4
  - 2D .cfg files and devel branch

# Discussion
- Surrogate that stores displacements (in t/uv) to make CAD watertight/design?
  - ONERA M6 with refine
  - delays problems that reemerge
- EGADS effective (virtual) topology
  - increases curvature at pcurves, not watertight at extreme resolution
- Discrete surrogate with equivalent edge and pcurve parameterization P1,P2,P3
- MeshLink support released by Pointwise, preliminary use in refine
- testing FUN3D-FV-HANIM, FUN3D-SFE, USM3D-HANIM
  - 2D and 3D benchmark cases with focus on convergence
  - subsonic in good shape, moving to transonic and supersonic (seeing progress)
  - isolated subset of FUN3D-FV issues to the Cb2 term in the SA
- Multiscale slow on small features (nozzle) in large domains
- refine+MOESS results in SciTech 2021 paper equivalent to EPIC
  - complexity interpretation needs to be matched

# Next full group meeting 10:00AM Eastern US 18-FEB-2021 (via Boeing webex)
- Every third Thursday going forward (via Boeing webex)
- JAN meeting second week of SciTech
