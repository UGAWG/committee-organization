  - Beckett, NASA
  - SU2: SA-DDES, SA-DDES-SLA; FUN3D-FV: SA-DDES, SA-DDES-SLA, FUN3D-SFE SA-DDES

# Discussion
- MeshLink support released by Pointwise, initial use in refine
- testing FUN3D-FV-HANIM, FUN3D-SFE, USM3D-HANIM
  - 2D and 3D benchmark cases with focus on convergence
- Multiscale slow on small features (nozzle) in large domains
  - multiscale adaptation to Spalding law-of-wall
  - involve gradation, weaken gradation in practice, solver convergence? 
  - FV vs. FE 
  - not needed for supersonic is FV, not used with (S)FE  
- push to move FUN3D+refine into "production"
  - bootstrap 65+ geometries initial meshes in automated testing
- working with Bob Haimes on EGADS improvments
  - legacy geometry import and initial tessellation
- vertex smoothing "flow" seen in other meshers?
  - differences in interpolation
  - differences in smoothing
- refine+MOESS gave poor results in SciTech paper
  - 2D results are equal to Avro and EPIC
  - Grid sizes produced by MOESS metric different between meshers
  - check the complexity to grid size ratio for test metrics
  - sinatan3 MOESS worst (multiscale seems ok)
  - use UGAWG cases to improve metric conformity
- EPIC+MOESS interaction

# Next full group meeting 10:00AM Eastern US 21-MAY-2020 (via Boeing webex)
- Every third Thursday going forward (via Boeing webex)
