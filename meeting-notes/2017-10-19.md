 - Mike Park
 - Todd Michal
 - Joshua Krakos
 - Nico Barral
 - Adrien Loseille
 - Dmitry Kamenetskiy
 - Dan Ibanez

# Action items for next meeting:
- for each metric conformity case
  - create a subdirectoy with your code name
  - include the *-metric.solb file that you interpolated
  - Adrien will also interpolate the metric to your adaptive grid for comparison
  - Nico reported that the supplied metric is near the current mesh 
- metric conformity priority
  - solution-adapt-results/hemisphere-cylinder/sa-m06-a00-fun3d/hsc03.meshb

  - solution-adapt-results/onera-m6/sa-m084-a306-fun3d/onera10.meshb
- Adrien add "silo" description of Wolf+Fefloa
- Dmitry, Todd, Josh add Lp results
- Adrien add Lp results
- Add output based results if time permits
- Mike compute Yplus based on constant like Adrien

# Paper
- Three separate integrated approaches or "silos"
  - GGNS+EPIC (Lp Mach, output)
  - FUN3D+refine (Lp Mach)
  - Wolf+Fefloa (Lp Mach, output)
- Discuss issues Lp slow to converge
  - Iterating at fixed complexity helpful to reduce yplus
  - Addition of boundary layers accelerate
  - Could replace y+<100 normal metric with exponential growth to converge faster (but would use tangent metric off surface)
  - Output based out performs Lp
- Comparisons of metric conformity
  - 25K complexity (50K nodes) FUN3D-refine
  - 161K nodes GGNS-EPIC
  - 100K complexity (200K nodes)  FUN3D-refine
