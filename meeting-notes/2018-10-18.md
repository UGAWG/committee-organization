# Parallel SciTech 2019 Paper
- Fill in tables that are start
- Optional case after primary submission is increasing radius cylinder metric
- August expect time table
- Two test cases will be used: 
  - The first one  will be a unit cube with metric polar-2 from previous UGAWG paper
  - The second is the delta-wing for metric see UGAWG/parallel-adapt-results
- For the cube case we will use three subcases each  with a goal of generating different number of elements. 1 million, 100 million 1 Billion
- Each participating software may run on any kind of hardware with as many cores as needed.
- Add specs of the machine : core frequency, amount (and speed) of RAM, number of cores, etc.
- In the results include tets/sec or vertices/sec as a measure of performance
- include performance of sequential code i.e., single core. 
- This is what data are currently on the paper and what is missing
