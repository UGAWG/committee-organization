# 3rd AIAA Geometry and Mesh Generation and 4th High Lift Prediction Workshops
  - Kick off meeting next week (Big Team)
  - AVIATION 2021 
  - Technology focus groups (Adaptive Meshing), Eddy-resolving, high-order, fixed-mesh
    Frederic, Todd, Dimitri Mavriplis (Wyoming), Ralf Rudnik (DLR), Mike
    - publish test cases and invite a larger group
    - steady RANS
    - verification (2D HL-CRM airfoil)
    - test cases defined, released early next week
    - Comparison to fixed meshes
    - joint presentation at workshop
    - participant list published
  - 2D
    - Rumsey verification case at 16deg, 4-5 meshes (run fun3d, but drag is off)
    - Full tri did not run
    - Orthogonal cells at wall, EPIC used BL insertion (metric, constrained by structure).
    - Pointwise re-generation?
    - more challenge for FV codes (unknown reasons)
    - strong solvers struggled too
    - with SFE? re-adapt with FUN3D-FV-HANIM?
    - TMR moved to Jim Masters structured grid (large, 2D) which may indicate that verification case is going to be tricky for adapt FG participants
    - allow results regardless of verification but provide for context
  - HL-CRM geometry being used for fixed mesh generation
    - Geometry released 2v (was v1a) worked out-of-the-box with ESP and Boeing

# AVIATION 2021 intro paper on assembly tolerence background
- NASA/Boeing abstract review deadlines: 22 Oct 2020
- Abstract Deadline: 10 November 2020
- NASA/Boeing review deadlines: 01 Apr 2021
- Manuscript Deadline: 04 May 2021
- problems, stratigies, and examples dissucssed AVIATION 2021
- solutions targed for Scitech 2022 (or IMR)
- tolerance, gaps, etc. vs. meshing requirements (surface, y+)
- Fixes for HLPW4 HL-CRM
  - Boeing found gap after 250M, undersized surface (compared to trim curves)
  - windshield curvature
  - geometry 1 had a circle tangent issue, resolved with 1a
  - curving FG using juncture flow model (simplified was missing faces)

# GMGW-2.5 Mesh Effects
   - AIAA journal submission: Boeing, NASA, INRIA, MIT
   - Todd submitted: unsubmitted, 1/3 too long and formatted (help requested)
     - Marshall and Todd reduced, Todd with resubmit and share for NASA review
   - MIT submitted

# SciTech 2021
- NASA/Boeing review deadlines: 01 Nov 2020
- Manuscript Deadline: 01 Dec 2020
- Verification of output metric in AIAA-2019-3947
  - INRIA output metric
  - NASA, INRIA, Boeing
  - analytic field with entropy adjoint
    - BCFD may add analytic solution
    - Marshall slight mod and created MMS
    - share adapt meshs for analysis 
  - actual solution Ringleb?
    - boundary output functional
    - output functional and MMS for output (marshal)
    - boundary conditions?
  - eval: draw ellipses, difference in metric fields (delta), metric conformity
  - laminar delta wing
  - laminar OM6
- Mike todo
  - update paper with Marshall functions
  - send out laminar and OM6 conditions
  - send out delta wing mesh (for geom)
  - confirm OM6 geom, https://github.com/UGAWG/solution-adapt-cases/blob/master/onera-m6/geometry/onera-m6-sharp-te.igs

# Proposed journal article in progress
- Fixed Grid verification extracted from adaptation for Hybrid RANS-LES
  - Beckett, NASA
  - SU2: SA-DDES, SA-DDES-SLA; FUN3D-FV: SA-DDES, SA-DDES-SLA, FUN3D-SFE SA-DDES
- SU2+FUN verification on hold due to solver difficulty

# Discussion
- Surrogate that stores displacements (in t/uv) to make CAD watertight/design?
- EGADS exploring effective (virtual) topology
- MeshLink support released by Pointwise, initial use in refine (restart)
- testing FUN3D-FV-HANIM, FUN3D-SFE, USM3D-HANIM
  - 2D and 3D benchmark cases with focus on convergence
  - subsonic in good shape, moving to transonic and supersonic (seeing progress)
- Multiscale slow on small features (nozzle) in large domains
  - multiscale adaptation to Spalding law-of-wall
  - involve gradation, weaken gradation in practice, solver convergence? 
  - FV vs. FE 
  - not needed for supersonic is FV, not used with (S)FE  
- refine+MOESS gave poor results in SciTech 2019 paper
  - 2D results are equal to Avro and EPIC
  - Grid sizes produced by MOESS metric different between meshers
  - check the complexity to grid size ratio for test metrics
  - sinatan3 MOESS worst (multiscale seems ok)
  - use UGAWG cases to improve metric conformity
- EPIC+MOESS interaction

# Next full group meeting 10:00AM Eastern US 19-NOV-2020 (via Boeing webex)
- Every third Thursday going forward (via Boeing webex)
