Abstract NASA/Boeing review deadlines: 11 May 2020
Abstract due: 01 June 2020
Paper NASA/Boeing review deadlines: Early November 2020
Paper due 02 December 2020
- Dmitry has a draft paper
- future work for SciTech 2021 paper
- understand scaling of NASA/BOEING and INRIA
- alternative presention of AIAA-2019-3947 metric
- compare to Josh analytic metric
  - draw ellipses, difference in metric fields (delta), metric conformity
- turbulent?
- share 2021 paper latex source with Dmitry
- Mike to add intro (early March)
- add sample results (delta wing, 2D)

# Next Next paper ideas (or topics for graduate students)
- linear mesh behavor for curved geometry
- multiscale (Hessian) radial gradient becomes tangential 2nd derivative
- does MOESS L2-norm or RANS show the same level of tangential refinement
- P1 vs. P2 (does high order capture the solution curvature)
- transform curved domain to Cartesian
- transform to cylindrical coordinates?
- scaling of shocks vs. boundary layer?
  - adaptation to Spalding law-of-wall and shock model (tanh?)
- metric gradation? impact on accuracy, solver convergence? 

# GMGW-2.5 Mesh Effects
- AIAA journal submission: Boeing, NASA, INRIA, MIT
- Joint paper accepted and NASA approved
- MIT proof submitted

# Parallel journal article
- response to per-review comments
  - insight into quality differences between codes
    - details on huristics
  - create bigger meshes
    - typical sizes for production adapted meshes

# Discussion
- Surrogate that stores displacements (in t/uv) to make CAD watertight/design?
  - ONERA M6 with refine
  - delays problems that reemerge
- Discrete surrogate with equivalent edge and pcurve parameterization P1,P2,P3
  - discontinuous slope artifacts at coarse resolution 
- EGADS effective (virtual) topology
  - evaluates underlying geometry derivaties, finite-difference blend region
  - alpha testing underway
- testing FUN3D-FV-HANIM, FUN3D-SFE, USM3D-HANIM
  - 2D and 3D benchmark cases with focus on convergence (metric confromity)
  - subsonic in good shape, moving to transonic and supersonic (seeing progress)
  - isolated subset of FUN3D-FV issues to the Cb2 term in the SA
- Multiscale slow on small features (nozzle) in large domains (student)
