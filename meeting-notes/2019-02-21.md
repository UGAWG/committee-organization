# AVIATION 2019 Abstract
- "Geometry Modeling and Adaptive Grid Mechanics for Unstructured Grids" Park, Kleb, Jones, Loseille, Krakos, Michal, Dannenhoffer, Hamies
  - High Lift WS (CRM gapped, CRM partial sealed, JAXA, next WS), C25D sonic boom, DPW CRM
  - share geometries with Tsolakis
  - initial grid generation for adaptation
    - curvature-based surface adapt before volume generation can improve efficiency
    - feature-based (short edge, narrow faces) constraint (efficiency)
    - folds (or near folds) in the NURBS
      - fix in CAD upstream?
      - avoid? coarsen mesh, reject points
      - how flag problems (alternating curvature)
      - relation to tolerence
      - CAD-fix diagnostics
    - isotropic initial volume, then curvature adaptation of surface+volume
    - curvature can also be used coarsen surface grid for efficiency
    - some geometry topology modification can help
      - split large faces
      - split wrap-around faces
      - redo construction steps to eliminate very small (unintended) features
    - surface adapt can be a preview of problems as a form of diagnostics
  - geometry issues: gaps and overlaps, short edges, how to deal or show negative consciences
  - geometry importance for fixed v. adapt meshing
  - geometry association: one-to-one or many-to-many virtual topology
  - include results of project with March completion (Wyman)
- "Adjoint-based Anisotropic Mesh Adaptation for a Stabilized Finite Element Flow Solver" Balan, Park, Anderson
  - SFE adjoint development
  - implementing published error estimates and metric construction
    - INRIA optimal-goal metric with viscous fluxes (weak BCs?)
    - laminar delta wing
- "Sketch-to-Solution: An Exploration of Viscous CFD with Automatic Grids" Kleb, Park, Wood, Bibb, Thompson, Gomez
  - exercise adaptive grid approach for NASA-relevant cases
  - OpenCSM, EGADS, refine, FUN3D
- "Hybrid RANS/LES Simulation of Vortex Breakdown Over a Delta Wing" Zhou, Diskin, Pardue, Chernikov, Tsolakis, Drakopoulos, Chrisochoides
  - SU2
  - 20M nodes, 100M cell typical: see DPW history, HL 300M median
  - fixed mesh: advancing layer and outer unstructured targeting larger grids
  - SA steady multiscale adaptive 10M, targeting larger grids
  - running steady adapted grids with HRLES
  - construct metric from HRLES solution

# Book on current state of parallel generation and adaptation
- Nikos is organizing
- waiting on template from publisher
- publisher go ahead, number of chapter commitments
- queries continue at SciTech
- 15-20 page per chapter, August 2019 draft 
  - Boeing interested
  - Park: refine algorithm

# Discussion
- refine+MOESS gave poor results in SciTech paper
  - Grid sizes produced by MOESS metric different between meshers
  - check the complexity to grid size ratio for test metrics
  - sinatan3 MOESS worst (multiscale seems ok)
- EPIC+MOESS interaction
- Check into world congress
- reach out to members

# SciTech 2019
 - well received UGAWG papers with discussion, full room
   - future work combing speed and scaling of interest to community

# 2nd AIAA Geometry and Mesh Generation Workshop Debrief
- next Geometry and Mesh Generation Workshop
   - with high lift 4 (AVIATION 2020) 
     - collect data and adaptation on solution accuracy
   - include adaptation component
   - involve UGAWG
 - AIAA MV-TC discussion group
   - make plan of attack for AIAA MV-TC (and maybe IMR) integration by AVIATION conference

# Next meeting 10:00AM Eastern US 21-March-2019 (via Boeing webex)
- Every third Thursday going forward
