# 3rd AIAA Geometry and Mesh Generation and 4th High Lift Prediction Workshops
  - 2D extruded geometry 
  - special session invited paper (AVIATION 2020?)  
     - provide adapted grids at same vertex count to participants
     - encourage sharing grids between solvers (e.g., FE, FV, NC, CC, commercial)
  - Workshop AVIATION 2021? 
     - include adaptation component
     - involve UGAWG
  - AIAA MV-TC discussion group
     - make plan of attack for AIAA MV-TC (and maybe IMR) integration by AVIATION conference
  - Todd abstract

# Proposed journal article in progress
- Fixed Grid verification extracted from adaptation for Hybrid RANS-LES
  - Beckett, NASA
  - SU2: SA-DDES, SA-DDES-SLA; FUN3D-FV: SA-DDES, SA-DDES-SLA, FUN3D-SFE SA-DDES

# Discussion
- MeshLink support released by Pointwise 
- testing FUN3D-FV-HANIM, FUN3D-SFE, USM3D-HANIM
  - 2D and 3D benchmark cases with focus on convergence
- Multiscale slow on small features (nozzle) in large domains
  - multiscale adaptation to Spalding law-of-wall
- push to move FUN3D+refine into "production"
  - bootstrap 40+ geometries initial meshes in automated testing
- working with Bob Haimes on EGADS improvments
  - legacy geometry import and initial tessellation
- vertex smoothing "flow" seen in other meshers?
  - differences in interpolation
  - differences in smoothing
- refine+MOESS gave poor results in SciTech paper
  - 2D results are equal to Avro and EPIC
  - Grid sizes produced by MOESS metric different between meshers
  - check the complexity to grid size ratio for test metrics
  - sinatan3 MOESS worst (multiscale seems ok)
  - use UGAWG cases to improve metric conformity
- EPIC+MOESS interaction

# Next meeting 10:00AM Eastern US 19-MAR-2020 (via Boeing webex)
- Every third Thursday going forward
