# Agenda
- geometry access with PointWise kernel - Nick 15 min talk next meeting
  - ability to exchange cases and work on geometry with different kernels
  - geometry association
  - tolerance, gaps, small faces, small edges, etc.
- Christos introduction talk
- clean up results repo (LFS grids, re-write history, invalidate working copies)
  - make the repo the most useful for least amount of work

# Next Paper
- two draft papers
  - parallel execution
    - execution time (relative or absolute)
    - omega_h is consistent, metric conformity statistics for other codes
    - tau bench equivalent (run open source code on your machine)
    - everyone run on same architecture, compiler, mpi, ...
  - verification of Lp Metric and/or complete cycle
    - Mike put reference formulation in refine
    - have Hessian recovery L2-projection, add k-exact?
    - simple is best for verification
    - need curvature constraint only for initial grids?
    - need to limit change from current mesh?
    - export intermediate pieces for examination (Hessian, gradation control, ...)
    - how to compare two Hessians, two metrics (distance between)
  - Balan, Park, Anderson SciTech paper
  - Michal World Congress Computational Mechanics Talk
- lead author volunteer and where (IMR, SIAM, AIAA, TM)
- OM6 trailing edge had lowest shape measure (Dan considering a metric that accounts for geometry, sharp features)
- connection between histograms, measures, and solver performance
- examine difference in Hemisphere Cylinder viscous drag for Lp adapt and fixed-grid refinement
- low mean ratio often near the wall, study spatial distributional; where are these problems?
- SciTech 2018 deadlines (to estimate SciTech 2019 deadlines)
  - Abstract Submission Opens: 27 March 2017 
  - Abstract Submission Closes: 12 June 2017
  - Author Notification: 25 August 2017 
  - Manuscript Deadline: 5 December 2017
