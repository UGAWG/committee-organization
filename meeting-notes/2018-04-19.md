# Parallel Paper
- Two test cases will be used: 
  - The first one  will be a unit cube with the quarter cylinder the analytic metric described at [CITE Marcum Frederic paper]
  - The other will be determined later, suggestions are welcome for the next meeting. Maybe something from the NASA common research set ?
- For the cube case we will use three subcases each  with a goal of generating different number of elements. 1 million, 100 million 1 Billion
- Each participating software may run on any kind of hardware with as many cores as needed.
- Add specs of the machine : core frequency, amount (and speed) of RAM, number of cores, etc.
- In the results include tets/sec or vertices/sec as a measure of performance
- include performance of sequential code i.e., single core. 

# Next meeting 14:00 UTC 17-May-2018 (via Boeing webex) 
- Every third Thursday going forward
- Park on travel
