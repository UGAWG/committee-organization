# Agenda
- Parallel journal article
  - Updated with latest results in repo
  - coarsening case added (CDT3D done, refine redo, need others)
  - refine coarsening results erratic need to investigate (fixed sweeps)
  - review draft and complete data for last case
- Geometry and Mesh Generation and High Lift Prediction Workshop support
- Meshing working group document on mesh suitability
  - mesh resolution Dannenhoffer and Wyman 
- HiFi CFD SciTech 2021 SA-QCR, Supersonic Duct, JFM, 2D airfoil, HL-CRM

# 3rd AIAA Geometry and Mesh Generation and 4th High Lift Prediction Workshops
  - 2D extruded geometry 
  - Workshop AVIATION 2021? 
     - include adaptation component
     - involve UGAWG
  - AIAA MV-TC discussion group
  - Todd and Mike providing geometry feedback (share link to current version)
    - Worked out-of-the-box with ESP

# SciTech 2021
- Abstract NASA/Boeing Review: 01 May 2020
- Abstract Deadline: 08 June 2020
- NASA/Boeing review deadlines: 01 Nov 2020
- Manuscript Deadline: 01 Dec 2020
- Verification of output metric in AIAA-2019-3947
  - INRIA output metric
  - NASA, INRIA, Boeing
  - analytic feild
  - hemisphere cylinder, laminar OM6, juncture flow model, HL-CRM, JAXA Standard Model
- SU2+FUN verification (unlikely)

# Proposed journal article in progress
- Fixed Grid verification extracted from adaptation for Hybrid RANS-LES
  - Beckett, NASA
  - SU2: SA-DDES, SA-DDES-SLA; FUN3D-FV: SA-DDES, SA-DDES-SLA, FUN3D-SFE SA-DDES

# Discussion
- MeshLink support released by Pointwise, initial use in refine
- testing FUN3D-FV-HANIM, FUN3D-SFE, USM3D-HANIM
  - 2D and 3D benchmark cases with focus on convergence
  - subsonic in good shape, moving to transsonic and supersonic
- Multiscale slow on small features (nozzle) in large domains
  - multiscale adaptation to Spalding law-of-wall
  - involve gradation, weaken gradation in practice, solver convergence? 
  - FV vs. FE 
  - not needed for supersonic is FV, not used with (S)FE  
- working with Bob Haimes on EGADS improvments
  - legacy geometry import and initial tessellation
- vertex smoothing "flow" seen in other meshers?
  - differences in interpolation
  - differences in smoothing
- refine+MOESS gave poor results in SciTech paper
  - 2D results are equal to Avro and EPIC
  - Grid sizes produced by MOESS metric different between meshers
  - check the complexity to grid size ratio for test metrics
  - sinatan3 MOESS worst (multiscale seems ok)
  - use UGAWG cases to improve metric conformity
- EPIC+MOESS interaction

# Next full group meeting 10:00AM Eastern US 18-JUN-2020 (via Boeing webex)
- During AVIATION?
- Every third Thursday going forward (via Boeing webex)
