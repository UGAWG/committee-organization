- Grid adaptation for Hybrid RANS-LES
  - Build off of NIA/ODU AVIATION paper
  - fixed-point metric for time-accurate HRLES
    - unit problem: delta wing
    - JSM WB
  - Multiscale Mach RANS
    - JSM WB through max-lift
  - Run GO4HYBRID grids with FUN3D-FV, FUN3D-SFE, SU2 (w/ Zhou)
  - Should of presented in an LES session?

# Book on current state of parallel generation and adaptation
- Nikos is organizing
- waiting on template from publisher
- publisher go ahead, number of chapter commitments
- queries continue at SciTech
- 15-20 page per chapter, TBD draft 
  - Boeing interested
  - Park: refine algorithm

# Discussion
- MeshLink support released by Pointwise 
- revisiting 2D with refine
  - EGADS facebody and parallel, refactoring to reduce duplication
  - to add surrogate geometry, virtual topology, curved mesh, moving mesh
- Multiscale slow on small features (nozzle) in large domains
  - multiscale adaptation to Spalding law-of-wall
- push to move FUN3D+refine into "production" (automated testing)
- working with Bob Haimes on EGADS improvments
  - legacy geometry import and initial tessellation
- vertex smoothing "flow" seen in other meshers?
  - differences in interpolation
  - differences in smoothing
- refine+MOESS gave poor results in SciTech paper
  - 2D results are equal to Avro and EPIC
  - Grid sizes produced by MOESS metric different between meshers
  - check the complexity to grid size ratio for test metrics
  - sinatan3 MOESS worst (multiscale seems ok)
  - use UGAWG cases to improve metric conformity
- EPIC+MOESS interaction

# Next meeting 10:00AM Eastern US 20-FEB-2020 (via Boeing webex)
- Every third Thursday going forward
