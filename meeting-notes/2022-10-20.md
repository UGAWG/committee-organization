# Eddy Resolving Meshing
- create unit problems for eddy-resolving adaptation, wall models, anisotropy
 - channel and flat plate flow (make periodic with mirroring)
- time vary analytic function to verify Barral metric
  - does not need zero residual, should excite residual terms like real turbulence, deterministic (psudo-random?)
- consistency with wall model (meshing to a yplus expectation of wall model RANS+WMLES)
  - segregate multiscale interpolation control from wall models
  - infer yplus for instantaneous snapshots (yplus is RANS concept)
  - enforce boundary conditions in the sensor
- WM-RANS-SA and explicit control of y+ in RANS-SA
- HRLES blending function to control aspect ratio to compress "gray-area"
  - HRLES aspect ratio controlled by DDES blending
- mesh based filter width or physics based filter width for LES
  - fix filter width and do refinement
  - https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09899 
  - "Verification and Validation: the Path to Predictive Scale-Resolving Simulations of Turbulence"
- ratio of resolved TKE and modeled, i.e., Pope 80%
- should tetrahedra be used at wall? mixed elements at wall or interior? solver preference
- reached out to Johan Larsson to discuss anisotropy and wall model needs
- Marshall + student join discussion: WMLES mesh adapt in SANS, Statistical errors
- WMLES resolving transition, laminar separation, etc and interactions with wall models
- define test cases and propagate to the wider community

# Discussion
- Dissipation in the FV solver has huge impact on results and solver (Joukowsky airfoil)
- Tangential wiggles in shocks FV (and their wake) is resolved: limiters, flux function dissipation, etc.
- Starting quad (2D) and prism (3D) insertion with refine
- continuous err est trace(M^(-1/2)|H|M^(-1/2)) Mopt = det(|H|)^(-1/(2p+d))|H|
- discrete error estimate integral(|Q2-Q1|)
- is multiscale equidistributing error? tried to extend to multiple sensors
- multiscale slow on small features (nozzle) in large domains
- multiscale slow to discover/resolve nonlinear (transported) features
- shocks overresolved (unless artificial dissipation limits hessian)?
- cases with poor edge curves (and replacement with missing degeneracies)
- Discrete surrogate with equivalent edge and pcurve parameterization P1,P2,P3
  - discontinuous slope artifacts at coarse resolution
  - entry to HO meshing
- SFE nonlinear elasticity for linear and HO meshes
- EGADS effective (virtual) topology
  - evaluates underlying geometry derivatives, finite-difference blend region

# Next Next paper ideas (or topics for graduate students)
- linear mesh behavior for curved geometry
- multiscale (Hessian) radial gradient becomes tangential 2nd derivative
- does MOESS L2-norm or RANS show the same level of tangential refinement
- P1 vs. P2 (does high order capture the solution curvature)
- transform curved domain to Cartesian
- transform to cylindrical coordinates?
- scaling of shocks vs. boundary layer?
  - adaptation to Spalding law-of-wall and shock model (tanh?)
- metric gradation? impact on accuracy, solver convergence? 

# Next virtual meeting 10:00AM Eastern US 17-NOV-2022
- Every third Thursday going forward (via Boeing webex, Josh manage series)
