# Parallel SciTech 2019 Paper
- Fill in tables that are start
- Add curved geometry? OM6? C = 50K or 100K
- August expect time table
- Two test cases will be used: 
  - The first one  will be a unit cube with metric polar-2 from previous UGAWG paper
  - The second is the delta-wing for metric see UGAWG/parallel-adapt-results
- For the cube case we will use three subcases each  with a goal of generating different number of elements. 1 million, 100 million 1 Billion
- Each participating software may run on any kind of hardware with as many cores as needed.
- Add specs of the machine : core frequency, amount (and speed) of RAM, number of cores, etc.
- In the results include tets/sec or vertices/sec as a measure of performance
- include performance of sequential code i.e., single core. 
- This is what data are currently on the paper and what is missing

# Err Est SciTech 2019 Paper
 - Add Laminar Delta Wing for DG (no grid curving)
 - Focus on OM6 TMR Case 2308: Minf=0.84, Rec_root=14.6 x 106, AoA=3.06 deg, Tinf=540 R.
 - Include analytic scalar field? Add example to refine 
   - analytic hessian from scalar
   - 3D scalar function? 
   - look up example in paper or create new
   - 2D example + z^2
   - integrate interpolate error 
 - Mike, Aravind, Kyle
   - FUN3D-FV and FUN3D-SFE with  refine multiscale metric + refine grid mechanics
   - analytic metric example
   - refine multiscale metric:
     - compare k-exact and L2-projection Hessian reconstruction,
     - show impact of gradation control
 - Todd, Josh, and Dmitry
   - analytic metric example
   - FUN3D-FV with Boeing tools
   - GGNS+EPIC with the refine multiscale metric and Boeing multiscale metric
   - GGNS+refine with the refine multiscale metric and Boeing multiscale metric
 - Adrien and Frederic
   - Wolf+Feflo.a with the refine multiscale metric and INRIA multiscale metric
   - Wolf+refine with the refine multiscale metric and INRIA multiscale metric
 - Hugh and Marshall
   - SANS+MOESS with refine and EPIC
   - SANS+refine multiscale metric with refine and EPIC
   - Laminar Delta Wing avoids curved grid
- Nicolas
   - Does your group have a compressible flow solver?
     If not, we could also include an analytic function like
     Adrien's AIAA-2007-4186 paper.

# Discussion
- added scalar field and interpolation error calculation to refine
  - linear interpolation between two grids, cell-based quadrature
- k-exact nodal Hessian reconstruction produces better
  results than L2-Projection for multiscale metric
